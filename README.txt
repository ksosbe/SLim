SLim.jar is a compiled executable for the project

You must first create a server with the "start server" menu item in the SLim menu in the upper left, then you may join your own server with the "join server" menu item in the SLim menu.

This project was designed for a software testing course; we had time to create the project, then we intentionally added bugs to the project and passed an executable and its source code to other teams for them to try to find and fix all of the bugs. Not all portions of the project work as intended (contacts, file transfer, and emoticons for example) due to time constraints of the five team members.

I, Kris Sosbe (ksosbe), was responsible for the files MacroHandler.java and Translate.java, as well as updates to the message handling protocols to account for anything I needed to add.
